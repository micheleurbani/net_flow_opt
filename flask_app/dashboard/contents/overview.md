# Welcome to NetFlowOpt

This webapp is an interactive version of the model presented in the paper
*"An approach for bi-objective maintenance scheduling on a networked system
with limited resources"*.

## Workflow

The workflow is pretty straightforward and it consists of the following three
steps:

1. Design the system structure and set components properties in "System
design".
2. Setup the parameters of the multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) in
"MOGA settings".
3. Analyze the solution: load the results of an experiment,
and browse through all the available maintenance plans in the tab "Solution
analysis".
