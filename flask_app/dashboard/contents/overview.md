# Welcome to NetFlowOpt

This webapp is an interactive version of the model presented in the paper
*"Maintenance optimization on a network flow problem: a bi-objective approach"*.

## Workflow

The workflow is pretty straightforward and it consists of the following three
steps:

1. Declaration of components' properties.
2. Setup the parameters of the multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA).
3. Analyze the solution: it is possible to load the results of an experiment,
and to browse through all the available maintenance plans.

### Declaration of components

### Setup the MOGA

### Solution analysis
