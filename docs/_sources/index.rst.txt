   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to NetFlowOpt's documentation!
======================================

The documentation concerns only the code used to represent the systems
structure and the genetic algorithm, whereas it does not concern the web
app-related code.
The `core` package contains the following three modules:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   core/system
   core/scheduler
   core/moga

which deals with the representation of system components, of the scheduling
objects (activities, groups of activities, and maintenance plans), and of the
NSGA-II algorithm respectively.

A primer to run experiments is the following:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   core/run

Indices and tables
